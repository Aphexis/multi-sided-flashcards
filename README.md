# Flexcards (Multi-Sided Flashcards)
Flexcards is a web app that allows users to create and study from flashcards with a flexible number of "sides" or categories of information. Currently deployed on Heroku [here](https://flexcards.herokuapp.com/)!

The backend is built using Flask and Python, connected to a Postgres database using SQLAlchemy. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), and Bootstrap.
